## Running the Program

1. First, you need to compile the TypeScript code by executing the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    tsc src/main.ts
    ```

2. Once the TypeScript compilation is successful, run the program by executing the JavaScript file using Node.js:

    ```bash
    node src/main.js
    ```

   This will execute the program and display the output in the console.

You can also create new units for game if needed.
